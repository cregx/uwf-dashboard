# UWF Dashboard

The Windows UI application "UWF Dashboard" offers the possibility of a simplified activation/deactivation of an already configured UWF on a local or a remote domain computer.
{: .fs-5 .fw-400}

Normally, one would use the console tool uwfmgr.exe to manage UWF but the UWF Dashboard can take over this task:

![overview-uwfdb](/assets/images/overview-uwfdb.svg)
{: .text-center }
![no-more-console](/assets/images/noconsole.svg)
{: .text-center }

## Still under development...

But note that UWF Dashboard is still under development. At the moment, it only has the basic functionality to activate and deactivate the UWF. The configuration of the UWF environment on the target system must be done using either uwfmgr.exe or PowerShell.
